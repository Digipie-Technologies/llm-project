Chipotle has 7+ years remaining on their lease with four (4), 5-year renewal options. Aspen Dental signed a new 10-year lease with three (3), 5-year renewal options. Aspen Dental’s space is under construction. Chipotle benefits from a modern design with outdoor seating and a Chipotlane (drive-thru).</p><p><strong>ATTRACTIVE RENT INCREASES:</strong> The Chipotle lease calls for a 10% rent increase every 5 years throughout the base term and at the start of each option period and the Aspen Dental lease calls for a 10% increase in year 6 and 8% increases at the start of each renewal option providing the investor with an attractive increase in revenue and hedge against inflation.</p><p><strong>MINIMAL LANDLORD RESPONSIBILITIES:</strong> Both Chipotle and Aspen Dental have net leases with minimal Landlord responsibilities. The tenants reimburse their pro-rata share of all operating expenses, repairs, and maintenance of the property, making it an attractive investment for the passive real estate investor.</p><p><strong>DYNAMIC CORPORATE TENANTS:</strong> The Property features a corporate guarantee with Chipotle, one of the most sought-after restaurant brands in the country. Total revenue for 2021 was $7.54 billion, an increase of 26.11% from 2020. Chipotle opened 215 new restaurants during 2021 bringing the total restaurant count at year-end to 2,966. Chipotle planned to open an additional 225-250 locations in 2022, 80% of which are expected to included a Chipotlane. The Aspen Dental network includes 900 offices, in 43 states, owned and operated by independent practice owners and dentists, who operate with clinical autonomy and share a commitment to creating access to care for those who need it most. These independent practice owners recorded more than five million patient visits in 2021, driven by a commitment to breaking down barriers to quality, affordable oral health care.</p><p><strong>CHIPOTLANE:</strong> Digital sales remain a major bright spot for the chain, growing 202.5% year over year to $776.4 million. Digital orders now make up 48.8% of sales, with about half of those orders for delivery and the rest for order-ahead transactions, such as instore pickup and Chipotlane drive-thrus. The drive-thrus (Chipotlanes) are significant for the chain, generating about 10% more in sales than those locations without them.</p><p><strong>PRIME RETAIL LOCATION:</strong> The Property is situated in one of the best locations in North Conway to capture passing motorists on the heavilytravelled US Route 302/NH Route 16 commercial corridor (White Mountain Highway) which includes most of the area’s retail, dining, lodging and entertainment options. The Property is also located adjacent to the entrance for Settler’s Green, a popular 75-store, 500,000 square foot shopping center which helps drive considerable traffic to the area.</p><p><strong>RECESSION & E-COMMERCE RESISTANT TENANT:</strong> With an Aging babyboomer population, and strong area demographics, the need for brick and mortar medical and dental office buildings will continue to increase. This industry is unaffected by recessions and the need for personal interaction and specific medical aids can not be satisfied through e-commerce.</p><p><strong>RETAIL TRADE AREA:</strong> Digital sales remain a major bright spot for the chain, growing 202.5% year over year to $776.4 million. Digital orders now make up 48.8% of sales, with about half of those orders for delivery and the rest for order-ahead transactions, such as in-store pickup and Chipotlane drive-thrus. The drive-thrus (Chipotlanes) are significant for the chain, generating about 10% more in sales than those locations without them.</p><p><strong>TRAFFIC COUNTS:</strong> More than 16,800 vehicles pass the Property daily along White Mountain Highway (US Route 302/NH Route 16).</p><p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS:</strong> Approximately 10,500 people live within 5-miles of the Property with an average household income of $89,393.

This fund facilitated fresh renovations for GSA Social Security and Dedicated Senior Medical Center spaces, parking lot improvements, a new TPO roofing for the Save A Lot outlet, and a fresh paint coat for the plaza and the professional building.</p><p>• The plaza is neighbored by standalone outlots, including Walgreens, McDonald’s, and Simmons Bank. These establishments enhance the overall traffic to the plaza and contribute to its vibrancy. As per data from Placer.AI, the McDonald’s outlet ranks in the top 30% of its locations nationwide, and the Walgreens is among the top 15%. However, these outlots aren't included in the plaza's offerings.</p><p>• North Oaks Plaza boasts impressive visibility and multiple entrance and exit points, granting convenient access from any route. It has four entryways on Natural Bridge Road (11,295 VPD), one of which is a semi-signalized intersection. The plaza can also be reached through alternate paths, including a rear entrance on O’Neil Avenue via Pasadena Boulevard. Additionally, a fully signalized junction lies close by, at the confluence of Natural Bridge Road and Lucas-Hunt Road, managing the dense traffic of these prominent routes.</p>",https://www.crexi.com/properties/1294211/missouri-north-oaks-plaza,1294211,1,North Oaks Plaza,https://images.crexi.com/assets/1294211/b68cb59d229044f3be7fa2bd400e4f3b_716x444.jpg,missouri-north-oaks-plaza,https://images.crexi.com/user-accounts/91297/96bd880385904213a7bc265a1206244a_150x100_resize.jpg,A&M Realty Inc,2023-10-19T16:51:07.399Z,FALSE,FALSE,24,FALSE,23130000,FALSE,2023-10-19T17:20:05.389Z,24,"[""Retail""]",TRUE,TRUE,On-Market,FALSE,"[{""address"":""1 - 175 N Oaks Plaza Saint Louis Mo 63121"",""city"":""St. Louis"",""county"":""St. Louis County"",""state"":{""code"":""MO"",""name"":""Missouri""},""zip"":""63121"",""latitude"":38.7014491,""longitude"":-90.2910601,""fullAddress"":""1 - 175 N Oaks Plaza Saint Louis Mo 63121, St. Louis, St. Louis County, MO 63121""}]",TRUE,TRUE,"[""Shopping Center""]",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,{},2023-10-19T16:27:16.386Z,AuthRequired,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,None,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.54,1744427,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Pro,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,[],30,15,200000,Net Lease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.1,40.4,7.3,39.6,1271,4.1,16.4,17.4,19,25.6,9.8,1.2,0,0,37298,1747,46.6,2004,53.4,4,5.4,10.7,12.7,4.5,11.2,17.2,11.9,6.1,57.4

All the anchor stores (51,219 sf, 54% of total occupancy) have been tenants at the center for approximately 15 years or greater. This has helped increase foot-traffic and maintain stable occupancy over time. The property boasts 98% occupancy with 2.5 years of WALT remaining as of 8/1/2023.

On the commercial real estate side, the national retail vacancy rate tightened to 5.4% in Q2 2023. The Salt Lake City retail market’s vacancy stands at 3.9%, among the nation lowest.

In addition, with nearly six years of weighted average term remaining, it creates a staggered future rollover with only 10.34% of the Property’s GLA expiring within three years.</p><p><strong>Strong Development Fundamentals with Prime Retail Location:</strong> The Property’s well-designed layout and lack of outparcels increase visibility and accessibility in the heart of Odessa’s main retail corridor.</p><p><strong>Broad E-Commerce Resistant Tenant Mix:</strong> Sherwood Village’s prime location has made it the top destination for retailers within the trade area, resulting in a diverse collection of national, regional, and local tenants that are e-commerce-resistant and synergistic, creating a dynamic mix.</p><p><strong>Thriving Retail Market:</strong> As part of the redevelopment, an additional 17,000 square feet of retail was built in 2020 and quickly absorbed, articulating the depth of the Odessa retail market.
