10 full acres and majority of tenants on monthtomonth leases this would be a valuable covered land play for future redevelopment especially considering location and the imminent redevelopment in the surrounding 5mile radius This area of city is primed for a ton of redevelopment including the HBU and Sharpstown areas just up Interstate 59 STRATEGICALLY PLACED ALONG BISSONNET ONE OF HOUSTONS MOST TRAVELED THOROUGHFARES This massive 104000 SF property sits on the Hard Corner of Bissonnet and Centre Parkway at a Signalized intersection just blocks from both Interstate 59 and Beltway 8 LOYAL TENANTS WITH LENGTHY TRACK RECORD Multiple tenants have tenancy that spans decades average tenure is well over 15 years providing a long lasting and strong working relationship with future management A healthy mix of products services and dining reinforce the culture and diversity of the shopping center TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC UPSIDE With proper management some focus on tenant improvements and a proper lease up of tenants the upside of a center with as much space as the Centre at Bissonnet is tremendous Wtih current market conditions and an assumption of 6 months to lease the stabilized NOI can be achieved within 3 years reflecting a occupancy of around 88 MARK TO MARKET RENT OPPORTUNITY Exceptionally low market rents for the current tenants ranging from 304 to 1494 with a weighted
