All the anchor stores (51,219 sf, 54% of total occupancy) have been tenants at the center for approximately 15 years or greater. This has helped increase foot-traffic and maintain stable occupancy over time. The property boasts 98% occupancy with 2.5 years of WALT remaining as of 8/1/2023. This provides stable and consistent yield with the ability to strategically implement new tenancy and increase net operating income over time.</p><p>Dynamic Retail Location – The center is located just 17 minutes from downtown Salt Lake City and 16 minutes from Salt Lake City International Airport, which is completing its $5.1B expansion and renovation. This asset is situated on Redwood Road which is a main traffic boulevard running north and south and features seamless connectivity to both I-15 and I-215. There are two grocers within a one-block radius, Smith’s Foods and Lucky Stores, both of which generate considerable traffic for the trade area.</p><p>Strong Area Demographics – This asset is strategically positioned within 5 miles of 139,557 households with a total population of 405,243 residents that feature strong average household incomes of $99,608. Within a one-mile radius there are 5,866 households with average household incomes of $106,007. Redwood Road and 7000 South serve as the main transportation corridors for these residents with 42,400 vehicles per day on Redwood Road and 26,920 vehicles per day on 7000 South.</p><p>Retail Market Resilience – Even in the face of economic challenges, the American consumer has shown resilience. In July 2023, retail sales increased by 0.7% compared to June, and they saw a 3.2% rise from July 2022. On the commercial real estate side, the national retail vacancy rate tightened to 5.4% in Q2 2023. The Salt Lake City retail market’s vacancy stands at 3.9%, among the nation lowest. Meanwhile, asking rents experienced a growth of 4.7% over the past year, reaching $23.47 per square foot.</p>",https://www.crexi.com/properties/1292031/utah-redwood-village-shopping-center,1292031,Redwood Village Shopping Center,https://images.crexi.com/assets/1292031/ca11ac02333d4db3b043d155b998700b_716x444.jpg,utah-redwood-village-shopping-center,https://images.crexi.com/brokers/4351/eda71be7b1f54edca139c0cf626c67de_150x100_resize.jpg,Cushman & Wakefield Salt Lake City,2023-10-17T16:07:02.661Z,TRUE,FALSE,1,FALSE,,FALSE,2023-10-17T16:07:02.662Z,1,"[""Retail""]",FALSE,TRUE,On-Market,FALSE,"[{""address"":""7064 S Redwood Rd"",""city"":""West Jordan"",""county"":""Salt Lake County"",""state"":{""code"":""UT"",""name"":""Utah""},""zip"":""84084"",""latitude"":40.6227309,""longitude"":-111.9401876,""fullAddress"":""7064 S Redwood Rd, West Jordan, Salt Lake County, UT 84084""}]",FALSE,FALSE,"[""Shopping Center""]",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,{},2023-10-17T16:02:42.579Z,AuthRequired,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,None,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Free,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extensive overhaul of the center included roof overlay, new plumbing, pylons signs and lighting, electrical improvements, major parking lot repairs, and an additional inline space.</p><p><strong>Secure Income Stream:</strong> The Property provides an investor with significant stability based on contractual rent paid by an evenly distributed composition, preventing concentration on one tenant or use. In addition, with nearly six years of weighted average term remaining, it creates a staggered future rollover with only 10.34% of the Property’s GLA expiring within three years.</p><p><strong>Strong Development Fundamentals with Prime Retail Location:</strong> The Property’s well-designed layout and lack of outparcels increase visibility and accessibility in the heart of Odessa’s main retail corridor.</p><p><strong>Broad E-Commerce Resistant Tenant Mix:</strong> Sherwood Village’s prime location has made it the top destination for retailers within the trade area, resulting in a diverse collection of national, regional, and local tenants that are e-commerce-resistant and synergistic, creating a dynamic mix.</p><p><strong>Thriving Retail Market:</strong> As part of the redevelopment, an additional 17,000 square feet of retail was built in 2020 and quickly absorbed, articulating the depth of the Odessa retail market. Odessa enjoys a very low vacancy of 2.10%, resulting in a cumulative rental increase of 12.20% over the past three years that will continue to trend based on minimal new developments, ensuring existing tenant retention and future tenant appeal if space becomes available.</p><p><strong>Signalized Intersection with Robust Traffic:</strong> Sherwood Village is located on a heavily trafficked signalized intersection of Dixie Boulevard and East 42nd Street, which serves as a primary neighborhood thoroughfare for residents of the mature trade area.

Sales increased by 24% over pre-COVID 2019 figures. Kroger ranks in the top 25% of Kroger stores in Illinois in foot traffic rankings according to the Placer.ai.</p></li><li>​<p><strong>Lack of Grocery Competition: </strong>There is a true lack of grocery competition in the market, with only Walmart and Aldi providing alternative options for grocery shopping. This is the only Kroger location within a 25-mile radius, and there are no full-service grocers within this same radius.</p></li><li>​<p><strong>Value-Add Opportunity: </strong>There are two suites totaling 6,415 square feet available for lease-up. If these suites are leased at market rental rates, a future owner can increase in place NOI by approximately 17%.</p></li><li>​<p><strong>Recent Leasing Momentum: </strong>King City Square has experienced strong leasing momentum with the recent renewals from VIP Nails, and Asian Buffet, and the new LOI with 101 Tobacco Shop. The leasing momentum demonstrates the desirability of King City Square and the tenants’ long-term commitment to the property.</p></li><li>​<p><strong>Complimentary Retailers: </strong>King City Square features a complimentary tenant mix with retail categories in fashion and beauty, apparel, pet supplies, and food and beverage. There are 1.3 million annual visits to the shopping center, according to Placer.ai, of which the shops generate 455,000 visits or 35% of the annual traffic.</p></li><li>​<p><strong>Strategic Location Along Broadway Street Retail Corridor: </strong>King City Square is located along Broadway Street, the main retail corridor in Mount Vernon, Illinois. Adjacent to the shopping center is Times Square Mall, home to national retailers like Dunham’s Sports, Big Lots, Bath & Body Works, and Ross Dress for Less. Other prominent national retailers along the corridor include Walmart Supercenter, Kohls, Aldi, and Lowe’s.</p></li><li>​<p><strong>Regional Access and High Traffic Counts: </strong>King City Square is located on Broadway and 42nd Streets with over 27,000 VPD. Broadway Street is the main east-west retail thoroughfare. A half mile east is Interstate 57, which runs north to Chicago, and Interstate 64, which connects St. Louis and Louisville. As a result of this strong regional location, there are over 1,100 hotel rooms in the immediate area.</p></li></ul>",https://www.crexi.com/properties/1290919/illinois-king-city-square,1290919,King City Square,https://images.crexi.com/assets/1290919/c2955324534143a283b22fd976e3d94a_716x444.jpg,illinois-king-city-square,https://images.crexi.com/brokers/10325/e874b1e72b474d6eaf3828ccaa693a31_150x100_resize.jpg,CBRE Oak Brook,2023-10-16T14:37:36.515Z,FALSE,FALSE,9,FALSE,,FALSE,2023-10-16T14:38:11.348Z,9,"[""Retail""]",TRUE,TRUE,On-Market,FALSE,"[{""address"":""415 S 42nd St"",""city"":""Mount Vernon"",""county"":""Jefferson County"",""state"":{""code"":""IL"",""name"":""Illinois""},""zip"":""62864"",""latitude"":38.31243596653476,""longitude"":-88.94293498540834,""fullAddress"":""415 S 42nd St, Mount Vernon, Jefferson County, IL 62864""}]",FALSE,TRUE,"[""Grocery Store"",""Shopping Center""]",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,{},2023-10-16T14:29:55.268Z,AuthRequired,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Required,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,778751,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Pro,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,[],,,,Value Add,,,,,,"[""Kroger""]","[""Pet Supplies Plus"",""CATO"",""Great Clps"",""Sally Beauty""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a Difference in Many People’s Lives as Independent Operators in the
Metropolitan Atlanta Market.​ in March, 1975, They Purchased Their First
Supermarket in Stockbridge, Georgia, Formerly Known as Kenney’s Market.​
With Very Little Money to Start Off With, Trying to Get Into the Store and Get
the Signage Up as Cheap as Possible, Gerald and Raymond Decided on
the Name Quality Because It Had the Same Number of Letters as Kenney’s
Markets, So They Just Took the Letters Out and Replaced Them With Quality.​
the Food Depot Name and Concept Arrived on the Scene in Late 1988.​ the
Conyers, Georgia Store Was the First Unit Converted to the Cost Plus 10%
Format.​ Difficult Times Were Ahead for Quality, but Their Perseverance to
Stay With the Decision They Made, Grew the Company Successfully to Where
It is Today.​ Food Depot’s Merchandising Techniques, Advertising Abilities,
Knowledge of Customer Wants, Competitive Pricing, a Desire to Serve Their
Customers Better Than Anyone Else and the Ability to Make Quick, Effective
Decisions, Continue to Drive Growth in the Company.​ From Conyers, the
Company Continued to Convert the Stores to the Food Depot Cost Plus
10% Concept.​ the Last Store Was Converted in February, 2004, When the
Newnan Store Was Relocated.​ the Stores Range in Size From 18,000 Square
Feet to 50,000 Square Feet.​ the Units Consist of Five Customary Departments,
Grocery, With Dairy and Frozen Food, Meat and Produce.​ Food Depot Still
Concentrates on the Basics and Doing It Right.​
Today, Food Depot is an Employee Owned Company That Serves Their
Customer Base With 41 Stores, Which Has Expanded Outside the Atlanta
Metropolitan Area to Include Stores in West Georgia, Columbus, Dublin
and Macon Areas.​ the Company Has Continued to Grow While Maintaining the Belief, That You Are Only as Good as Your Employees.​ Taylor and Johnson
Consider Their Roles as the Caretakers of the Employee Owned Company,
Making Sure the Company Remains Strong, Continues to Grow and Never
Lets Its Employees Down.​
a True Diamond in the Rough, Food Depot Shines Like a Highly Polished
Gem That Everyone is Proud to Have an Association; Because Truth, Honesty,
Integrity, a Firm Handshake, Doing What You Say You Will Do, Never Giving
in and Treating Your Customers and Your Employees With Respect Have
Proven Successful in a Very Tough, Competitive Business.​

Consequently, there is a 41% expense slippage that may be recaptured with lease renegotiations.</p><p>b.       <strong>157% Market-to-Market Redevelopment Rents.</strong> Existing rents at the shopping center range from $11.54 - $20.00 per sq. ft. full service annually (avg. $13.59/sf). Meanwhile, market alternatives in the immediate trade area range from $18.00 - $30.00 per sq. ft. triple net. These retailers share the same traffic and demographic base.</p><p>c.       <strong>Existing Parcel Boundaries Enable Segmented Future Resale.</strong> Shamrock Square currently operates as one cohesive shopping center, yet existing parcel boundaries separate the Property into three distinct units. Future ownership benefits from the exit flexibility of marketing these parcels for sale separately.</p><p>d.       <strong>Short Term Leases Create Business Plan Flexibility.</strong> All leases expire December 31, 2023. However, tenant tenures range from 2-29 years at the property (12.37 years, on average), and most tenants have requested 3-5 years extensions. Alternatively, future ownership may let the leases expire and execute their business plan per their timeline.</p><p>e.       <strong>Zero Competing Owner User Alternatives. </strong>There is presently no comparable owner user opportunity in the Medford market. Also, because the buildings already exist on separate tax lots, there is an ability to own and operate a portion of the property independent from the rest (see Appendix A for details).</p><p>f.        <strong>Zero Development Alternatives.</strong> There are no competing properties for sale with comparably strong retail fundamentals to Shamrock Square. With all leases set to expire December 31, 2023, a developer may t renegotiate leases terms as needed to cover carry costs during the entitlement period.</p><p></p><p>2.       <strong>Neighborhood Amenities Create Long-term Value.</strong> Shamrock Square benefits from immediate exposure to secondary traffic visiting the Providence Medford Medical Center, a 168-bed hospital north of the property, and the Medford Center, a 415,105 sq. ft. power center anchored by T.J. Maxx, Ross, Burlington, and Safeway southwest of the property.</p><p></p><p>3.       <strong>High Visibility, High Synergy Signalized Intersection.</strong> Shamrock Square is situated at the northeast corner of a high visibility intersection across from Safeway and Chase Bank.

The subject property is located in a high barrier to entry market in Salt Lake City, UT.​ The property has great exposure to high traffic counts as it sits between State Street (28,000 AADT) and Main Street (7,500 AADT).​ The property has good ingress and egress with direct access from both streets.​ It also has great access to major freeways including I-15 which is the Major North South Interstate with traffic counts of 209,000 AADT and I-80 which is the major East West Interstate with traffic counts of 118,000 AADT.​ The site is flat and has plenty of parking for most business uses.​
Salt Lake City Economy
Salt Lake City's expanding economy has boosted its retail fundamentals.​ New construction has been limited in the past five years while demand remains constant, resulting in all-time low vacancies which are now at 2.7%.​ Total employment has grown by 29.1% in the past 10 years while the median household income has increased by 45.8%.​ The strong consumer base is also supported by the fast-growing Lehi and Provo areas, located just south of the Salt Lake City metro area.​
Retail rents in the Salt Lake City market were rising at a 6.3% annual rate during the second quarter of 2023, and have posted an average annual gain of 6.4% over the past three years.​ In addition to 600,000 SF that has delivered over the past three years (a cumulative inventory expansion of 1.0%), there is 250,000 SF currently underway.​
Employment in the metro was recently increasing at an annual rate of 3.3%, or a gain of about 26,000 jobs.​
Buy the R&F Mart Business or Re-tenant the Space
If a new owner choses to buy the R&F Mart Business they will get the opportunity to continue to expand Salt Lake Cities largest Asian Supermarket wholesale and retail grocery store.​ R&F Mart is thriving with a growing client base and 2022 revenue of just under $25,000,000.​ The owner is asking $6,000,000 for the business.​ If a new owner choses to buy the property and re-tenant the R&F mart space of 44,500 SF at a conservative market rent of $18/SF NNN.​ This would allow a new owner to charge $801,000 annually or more for this space.​
Value Add Thru Rental Increases and Expense Recapture
Salt Lake City experienced healthy economic and population growth over the past decade, along with increasing median income, driving retail consumption.​ Compressed vacancies have given landlords pricing power and rent gains here are among the best in the nation.​ Annual rent growth is currently posting gains of around 6.3%.​ Average asking rents in the metro are approximately $23.00/SF.​ This opportunity gives a new owner the ability to significantly increase the value of this asset by increasing rents over time.​ All tenants pay below market rents and many of the tenants pay rent that is significantly below market rents.​ Additionally, many leases could be changed to a full NNN structure to recapture additional expenses.​
Property in Great Condition - Pride of Ownership
The current ownership has made many property upgrades and improvements.​ The R&F Mart Building was built in 2020 with the owner spending over $5,900,000 including adding over $650,000 in Coolers and Freezers.​ China Town Plaza has also seen many upgrades since 2019 including over $740,000 in upgrades.​
Coldwell Banker Commercial is pleased to present the opportunity to purchase an absolute gem of a property including China Town Plaza, Arby's and R&F Mart.​ With the purchase of this investment a new owner will have the choice of either purchasing the entire property with the R&F Mart business or purchasing the property and retenanting the R&F Mart building.​ Any new owner will have immediate cash flow with existing in place tenants including Arby's and the tenants in China Town Plaza while they re-tenant the R&F Mart space or takeover the R&F Mart Business.​ Financials, Rent Roll and Due Diligence materials are available upon execution of a signed Confidentiality Agreement.​ Please do not disrupt the current tenants or tour the property without a scheduled tour.​ Call Paul Pursell at 984-284-9045 for more details or to schedule a tour of the property.​",,https://www.crexi.com/properties/1219373/utah-rf-mart-china-town-plaza-and-arbys,1219373,"R&F Mart, China Town Plaza and Arby's",https://images.crexi.com/assets/1219373/90f7da713b46401796649f593fca622b_716x444.jpg,utah-rf-mart-china-town-plaza-and-arbys,https://images.crexi.com/user-accounts/109621/5450667866c54e99b36d6c3264e324b8_150x100_resize.jpg,Coldwell Banker Commercial Realty,2023-08-31T10:40:04.078Z,FALSE,FALSE,7,FALSE,0,FALSE,2023-08-31T22:13:53.775Z,7,"[""Retail""]",FALSE,TRUE,On-Market,FALSE,"[{""address"":""3424-3435 S State St"",""city"":""Salt Lake City"",""county"":""SALT LAKE"",""state"":{""code"":""UT"",""name"":""Utah""},""zip"":""84115"",""latitude"":40.6971148,""longitude"":-111.8887876,""fullAddress"":""3424-3435 S State St, Salt Lake City, SALT LAKE, UT 84115""}]",FALSE,TRUE,"[""Shopping Center""]",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,{},2023-08-31T10:40:04.078Z,AuthRequired,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,None,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Pro,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Realogy,,,,,

impressive daily traffic count of 102,870 vehicles.​ Positioned on the signalized, hard-corner intersection of East Lincoln Highway and Colorado Street, the center offers easy ingress and egress from both streets.​ With 645 feet of unobstructed frontage along Lincoln Highway, it captures the attention of approximately 36,228 vehicles each day.​<br><br>Beyond its retail appeal, this location offers

Prior to Club 4 Fitness’ current tenancy, a Tom Thumb grocery store successfully operated at this location for approximately 30 years and helped establish Valley Ranch Centre as a preferred neighborhood shopping center serving Coppell and Las Colinas.

Market rents in the immediate submarket average between $24-$32 per square foot depending on space size and configuration.

Less than one-third of the shopping center’s gross leasable area (GLA) associated with tenant leases will expire prior to December 2029, thus providing cash flow stability with continued rent growth.
