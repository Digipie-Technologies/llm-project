ALWAYS BETTER THE BOUTIQUE OFFICE SPACE TREND F rom startups and tech giants to oldschool local firms businesses are rethinking the role of office space When the Covid19 pandemic hit and along with it the enforced workfromhome orders many companies realized they could operate with less than half the amount of office space Instead of a sprawling capitalintensive footprint more work can be done virtually with a scaleddown office home base Ar chitecture firms are anticipating that offices may no longer be places where individuals congregate to do their work in parallel but visit sometimes to collaborate The result will be a reduction of square footage and companies considering the benefits of smaller satellite offices Small floor pla tes that allow smaller tenants to have full floor offices with direct access while larger tenants are able to occupy the whole building instead of just a handful of floors Companies are also looking for office spaces on the ground floor to avoid having to use an elevator T rends have pointed to an imminent mass migration of millennials out of the cities to the suburban communities where they plan to raise families Companies with downtown real estate could follow this rush to the suburbs where space is plentiful and social distancing is much easier to enforce Sources Marker CNBC Biznow NEW MANAGEMENT KEEPING COSTS DOWN LEASING UP Recent new

development have high potential and where existing land uses indicate such a mixture In addition these regulations will allow mixing of certain normally noncompatible uses with the provision that proper open spaces sign control sufficient lot sizes increased setbacks and good design are provided This will help ensure that existing residences are protected against encroachment by industrial and business nuisances and similarly the ills of traditional strip commercial and industrial development will be discouraged The purpose of the IB district will be to provide for and encourage the proper

pandemic hit and along with it the enforced workfromhome orders many companies realized they could operate with less than half the amount of office space Instead of a sprawling capitalintensive footprint more work can be done virtually with a scaleddown office home base Ar chitecture firms are anticipating that offices may no longer be places where individuals congregate to do their work in parallel but visit sometimes to collaborate The result will be a reduction of square footage and companies considering the benefits of smaller satellite offices Small floor plat es that allow smaller tenants to have full floor offices with direct access while larger tenants are able to occupy the whole building instead of just a handful of floors Companies are also looking for office spaces on the ground floor to avoid having to use an elevator T rends have pointed to an imminent mass migration of millennials out of the cities to the suburban communities where they plan to raise families Companies with downtown real estate could follow this rush to the suburbs where space is plentiful and social distancing is much easier to enforce Sources Marker CNBC BiznowBenefits of NovaAtlas

1990s the Property underwent its first 50 million renovation unveiling a new 8screen Cineplex Odeon movie theater and was rebranded Sharpstown Center as it was quickly becoming more than a shopping mall it was a destination By 2010 the center was renamed PlazAmericas as part of another 10 million rebranding and revitalization project Each new life and vitality of this historic center reflects the bright future ahead of it and a storied past behind it With approximately 190000 SF of vacant space PlazAmericas also presents a unique leaseup opportunity that could be attractive to a variety of

Sharpstown OverviewSharpstown History Sharpstown is a masterplanned community in the Southwest Management District formerly Greater Sharpstown Southwest Houston Texas It was one of the first

schools shopping and recreation areas While this model has been duplicated countless times in the past fifty years at the time it was quite revolutionary attracting national media attention Sharp

its corridors was the Clock of Texas diorama an animated look at the history of Texas through the centuries Sharp would also place a time capsule in the cornerstone of the mall In 1981 twenty years after the mall opened a second floor was added effectively doubling the malls store count to well over 100 and the mall was extensively renovated from its original 1950s appearance to better compete with Westwood Mall and the Galleria In addition a food court was also added into the development By February 1989 Sharpstown Mall was 97 occupied making it the mall with the highest percentage of occupied space in the Houston area In 1993 the mall underwent a 50 million renovation with the largest addition being a new tenscreen Cineplex Odeon movie theater The mall was also rebranded as
